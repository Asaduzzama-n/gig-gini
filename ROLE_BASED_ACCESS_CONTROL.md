# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## ✅ **Security Issue Fixed**

### **Problem**
Previously, any authenticated user could access any dashboard (admin, employer, or employee) by manually navigating to the URL, which was a major security vulnerability.

### **Solution**
Implemented comprehensive role-based access control using layout-level protection that prevents unauthorized access to role-specific areas.

## 🛡️ **Implementation Details**

### **Layout-Level Protection**
Created role-specific layouts that wrap all pages in each section:

#### **Admin Layout** (`/admin/*`)
```typescript
// src/app/(dashboard)/admin/layout.tsx
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['admin']}>
  {children}
</ProtectedRoute>
```

#### **Employer Layout** (`/employer/*`)
```typescript
// src/app/(dashboard)/employer/layout.tsx
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['employer']}>
  {children}
</ProtectedRoute>
```

#### **Employee Layout** (`/employee/*`)
```typescript
// src/app/(dashboard)/employee/layout.tsx
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['employee']}>
  {children}
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### **Access Control Logic**
The `ProtectedRoute` component now:

1. **Checks Authentication**: Verifies user is logged in
2. **Validates Role**: Ensures user has required role for the section
3. **Automatic Redirect**: Redirects unauthorized users to their appropriate dashboard
4. **Loading State**: Shows loading spinner during authentication check

## 🔐 **Access Restrictions**

### **Admin Users** (`admin@giggini.com`)
- ✅ **Can Access**: `/admin/*` (all admin pages)
- ❌ **Cannot Access**: `/employer/*`, `/employee/*`
- **Redirect**: If tries to access employer/employee areas → redirected to `/admin`

### **Employer Users** (`employer@giggini.com`)
- ✅ **Can Access**: `/employer/*` (all employer pages)
- ❌ **Cannot Access**: `/admin/*`, `/employee/*`
- **Redirect**: If tries to access admin/employee areas → redirected to `/employer`

### **Employee Users** (`employee@giggini.com`)
- ✅ **Can Access**: `/employee/*` (all employee pages)
- ❌ **Cannot Access**: `/admin/*`, `/employer/*`
- **Redirect**: If tries to access admin/employer areas → redirected to `/employee`

## 🚀 **How to Test Role-Based Access**

### **Test 1: Admin Access Control**
1. Login as admin (`admin@giggini.com` / `password123`)
2. Try to manually navigate to `/employer` or `/employee`
3. **Expected**: Automatically redirected back to `/admin`

### **Test 2: Employer Access Control**
1. Login as employer (`employer@giggini.com` / `password123`)
2. Try to manually navigate to `/admin` or `/employee`
3. **Expected**: Automatically redirected back to `/employer`

### **Test 3: Employee Access Control**
1. Login as employee (`employee@giggini.com` / `password123`)
2. Try to manually navigate to `/admin` or `/employer`
3. **Expected**: Automatically redirected back to `/employee`

### **Test 4: Unauthenticated Access**
1. Logout (if logged in)
2. Try to navigate to any dashboard URL
3. **Expected**: Redirected to `/login`

## 🎯 **Protected Areas**

### **Admin Section** (`/admin/*`)
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/users` - User management
- `/admin/competitions` - Competition oversight
- `/admin/analytics` - Platform analytics
- `/admin/settings` - System settings
- `/admin/subscriptions` - Subscription management
- All other admin sub-pages

### **Employer Section** (`/employer/*`)
- `/employer` - Employer dashboard
- `/employer/competitions` - Competition management
- `/employer/candidates` - Candidate tracking
- `/employer/analytics` - Hiring analytics
- `/employer/settings` - Employer settings
- All other employer sub-pages

### **Employee Section** (`/employee/*`)
- `/employee` - Employee dashboard
- `/employee/competitions` - Available competitions
- `/employee/applications` - Job applications
- `/employee/achievements` - Badges and achievements
- `/employee/leaderboard` - Rankings
- `/employee/settings` - Employee settings
- All other employee sub-pages

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **File Structure**
```
src/app/(dashboard)/
├── admin/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Admin-only protection
│   ├── page.tsx            # Admin dashboard
│   ├── users/page.tsx      # Protected by layout
│   └── ...                 # All admin pages protected
├── employer/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Employer-only protection
│   ├── page.tsx            # Employer dashboard
│   ├── competitions/page.tsx # Protected by layout
│   └── ...                 # All employer pages protected
├── employee/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Employee-only protection
│   ├── page.tsx            # Employee dashboard
│   ├── applications/page.tsx # Protected by layout
│   └── ...                 # All employee pages protected
└── layout.tsx              # General dashboard layout
```

### **Security Benefits**
- **Layout-Level Protection**: All pages in a section are automatically protected
- **Automatic Redirects**: Users can't access unauthorized areas
- **No Manual URL Access**: Direct URL navigation is blocked for unauthorized roles
- **Consistent Security**: All sub-pages inherit protection from layout
- **Better UX**: Users are redirected to appropriate areas instead of seeing errors

## ✨ **Security Features**

✅ **Role-Based Access Control** - Users can only access their designated areas  
✅ **Automatic Redirects** - Unauthorized access attempts redirect to appropriate dashboard  
✅ **Layout-Level Protection** - All sub-pages automatically inherit security  
✅ **Authentication Validation** - Unauthenticated users redirected to login  
✅ **Loading States** - Smooth UX during authentication checks  
✅ **URL Protection** - Manual URL navigation blocked for unauthorized roles  

## 🎉 **Result**

The system now provides **complete role-based security**:

- **Admin users** can only access admin areas
- **Employer users** can only access employer areas  
- **Employee users** can only access employee areas
- **Unauthenticated users** are redirected to login
- **Unauthorized access attempts** result in automatic redirects to appropriate dashboards

This ensures that sensitive admin functions, employer hiring tools, and employee personal data are properly segregated and protected based on user roles.
