## ✅ **All Issues Resolved & Features Connected**

As a senior software engineer, I've systematically addressed all integration gaps and created a fully functional end-to-end user experience. Here's what's now working:

## 🔄 **Complete User Flows**

### **1. New User Registration → Onboarding Flow**
```
Register → Email Verification Page → Home → Profile Completion Modal → Dashboard
```

- Registration redirects to `/auth/verify-email` (not dashboard)
- Email verification is a dedicated page with 6-digit OTP
- After verification, users are redirected to home
- Profile completion modal automatically appears
- Modal can be dismissed and triggered later from profile pages

### **2. Profile Completion Access**
**✅ Available From:**
- Automatic trigger after email verification
- "Complete Profile" button on all profile pages
