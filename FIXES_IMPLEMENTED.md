# Fixes Implemented - Frontend V2 Issues Resolution

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Maximum Update Depth Error**
**Problem**: Infinite re-renders in `useProfileCompletion` hook causing React to throw "Maximum update depth exceeded" error.

**Solution**:
- Updated `useProfileCompletion` hook to prevent unnecessary state updates
- Added conditional checks to only update state when values actually change
- Changed dependency array to only depend on `user?.id` instead of entire `user` object

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useProfileCompletion.ts`

### 2. **Modal/Dropdown Background Transparency**
**Problem**: All modals and dropdowns had transparent backgrounds instead of white.

**Solution**:
- Updated `DialogContent` component to use `bg-white` instead of `bg-background`
- Fixed `SelectContent` component background from `bg-popover` to `bg-white`
- Fixed `DropdownMenuContent` and `DropdownMenuSubContent` backgrounds to `bg-white`
- Added proper border styling for better visibility

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/select.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`

### 3. **Authentication Flow Issues**
**Problem**: After registration, users were redirected to dashboard before email verification, and OTP modal appeared inappropriately.

**Solution**:
- **Created dedicated email verification page** (`/auth/verify-email`) instead of modal
- **Updated registration flow** to redirect to verification page instead of dashboard
- **Enhanced auth store** with email verification state tracking
- **Updated middleware** to handle verification page routing
- **Modified onboarding provider** to not show modals on auth pages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/stores/authStore.ts` - Added `pendingEmailVerification` and `updateUserVerificationStatus`
- `src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` - Changed redirect to verification page
- `src/app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx` - New verification page
- `src/components/auth/EmailVerificationPage.tsx` - New verification component
- `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingProvider.tsx` - Conditional modal display
- `src/middleware.ts` - Added verification page routing

## üîÑ **New Authentication Flow**

### Before (Problematic):
1. User registers ‚Üí Immediately redirected to dashboard
2. OTP modal appears on dashboard (confusing UX)
3. User completes verification while on dashboard

### After (Fixed):

2. User completes email verification on dedicated page
